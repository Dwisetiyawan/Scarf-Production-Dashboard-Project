*Production Monitoring Dashboard*

With the dashboard above, key informations in production process such as productivity, downtime, running hour, and frequency of trouble occured can be monitored in a single display. Machine selection button created for user to select which machine to be highlighted on the charts, so user could easily see how the performance of the machine selected showed on each chart. Accumulating productivity shows how many pieces product (scarf) are produced by each machine per hour over an accumulated period of time. Accumulating running hours indicates the total time each machine has operated over a specified period. Average running hours indicates the average time of ech machine operated in a day. Accumulating downtime shows how much time is lost because of the stopped production process during production in a day over an accumulated period of time. The causes of downtime for each machine are shown on the trouble frequency chart, showing how many times trouble occurred at each machine over an accumulated period of time. Another trouble frequency chart created to monitor how many times specific type of trouble occured during specified period. Both of the trouble frequency chart created to help user decide which machine or which type of trouble should prioritize to be fixed.
